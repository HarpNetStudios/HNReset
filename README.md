# HNReset
A simple set of scripts to strip as much as possible from the default ROBLOX code.

## What is it?
If you do any website design, will probably have heard of or used a reset.css of some sort to get you to a cleaner-than-normal state. That's what these scripts do, except for ROBLOX. It resets character spawning, health generation, GUIs and so on. Everything is as clean as possible.

## How can I help?
